## 💡 Project Overview

This repository documents the quantitative modeling and simulation of a **Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)** cell based on a **Hafnium Dioxide ($\text{HfO}_2$)** active layer.

This project showcases strong analytical and simulation skills, making it highly relevant for R&D roles in quantitative modeling, specialized Machine Learning, and semiconductor physics internships.

**Goal:** Develop a robust, predictive physical model in **MATLAB** that accurately captures the electrical dynamics and physical mechanisms of the RRAM device's non-volatile switching behavior.

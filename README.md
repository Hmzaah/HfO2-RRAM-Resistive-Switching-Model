# ⚡️ RRAM Simulation: Resistive Switching Model in HfO₂

**Project Author:** K Mohammed Hamza

### 🌟 Project Summary

This repository hosts the simulation assets and analysis for modeling **Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)** based on a **Hafnium Dioxide ($\text{HfO}_2$)** active layer. The goal was to quantitatively simulate the I-V characteristics of a non-volatile memory cell, demonstrating the physical transition between the High Resistance State (HRS) and Low Resistance State (LRS). This project showcases strong quantitative modeling and data analysis skills essential for R&D roles in semiconductors and data science.

### 💡 Background and Motivation

RRAM is a leading candidate for next-generation non-volatile memory due to its high density and low power consumption. The device operates by forming and rupturing a conductive filament within the $\text{HfO}_2$ layer. This work focused on developing a predictive model to accurately capture the SET and RESET processes under electrical bias.
